HTML4
HTML4 has a very loose syntax - for example closing tags are often optional.
 As an example - paragraphs in HTML4 are automatically ended when a new paragraph is started.
  (you don't have to close a paragraph with a tag in HTML4)

This loose syntax was great for amateur developers and made HTML very easy to adopt - however loose syntax isn't great if you want to achieve a specific result across browsers, as it makes it harder for browsers to accurately guess at what you mean (all browsers interpret HTML slightly differently, which with the number of different browsers in use today makes HTML4 unreliable)

To counter this problem, XHTML was introduced - and whilst we still refer to HTML as plain old "HTML" - the majority of sites developed today ACTUALLY use XHTML.
XHTML

XHTML stands for eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language.
 It’s actually a specific dialect of XML which is a generalised markup language.
  The main difference between XHTML and HTML4 is that all tags, once opened, must be closed. 
  There are also some restrictions about what tags can be nested inside each other. 
  These restrictions are sensible and you probably won’t run up against them.

The browser will make no assumptions and will allow you your mistakes.
 Aside from this, all the tags are the same as for HTML4. 
 This is why XHTML is now the language used by most professional web developers.

 XHTML
Filename extension	.xhtml, .xht, .xml, .html, .htm
UTI conformation	publi.xml
Developed by	World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
Initial release	26 January 2000
Latest release	5.0 28 October 2014
HTML 4 supports more multimedia options, scripting languages, style sheets, better printing facilities, and documents that are more accessible to users with disabilities.
HTML 4.0, a major update to the HTML specification, was published as a W3C Recommendation in December 1997 and revised in April 1998. 
It was superseded by a minor update, to HTML 4.01, in December 1999.
